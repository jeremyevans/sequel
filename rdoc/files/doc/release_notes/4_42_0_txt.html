<ul><li>
<p>There have been numerous improvements this release related to frozen
datasets.  Frozen datasets now work in almost all cases, except when
calling a dataset mutation method.</p>

<p>When using ruby 2.4, <a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> uses
the new support for clone(:freeze=&gt;false) to actually freeze datasets
while allowing them to copy singleton classes/extended modules from the
dataset calling clone.  On earlier versions of ruby, the dataset opts are
now frozen, preventing more types of accidental modification.</p>

<p>The dataset internals were refactored to reduce the number of instance
variables.  Now, datasets store all of their state in opts.  Additionally,
all datasets now use a thread-safe cache for storing cached state such as
the dataset&#39;s columns. Previously, accessing/setting the columns was
not thread-safe, unless the ruby interpreter used thread-safe methods for
instance variable getting/setting.</p>

<p>Frozen datasets use this new cache to optimize repeated method calls,
resulting in substantial performance speedups.  This can include caching
returned and/or intermediate datasets, SELECT and DELETE SQL generated, as
well as internal objects designed to optimize the building of SQL strings
with different arguments.</p>

<p>Even for fairly simple datasets, this can result in up to 10x performance
improvements for dataset methods that don&#39;t require database access,
and up to 3x performance improvements for dataset methods that do require
database access.</p>
</li><li>
<p>A freeze_datasets Database extension has been added which automatically
freezes all datasets for the Database instance. This also enables dataset
caching when creating datasets using Database#[] and from using a single
symbol, such as <a href=":table_name">DB</a>.  In addition to speeding up
the methods themselves, this also allows code such as:</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-constant">DB</span>[<span class="ruby-value">:foo</span>].<span class="ruby-identifier">for_update</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">first</span></pre>

<p>To run much faster by avoiding any dataset creation or SQL string building
after the first call.</p>

<p>The freeze_datasets extension makes dup an alias of clone, ensuring that
all cloned datasets that were originally created by the Database instance
are frozen.</p>

<p>It is highly recommended that you start using the freeze_datasets extension
in your applications using <a
href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a>, as this extension will
become the default and only behavior in <a
href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> 5.  Unfrozen datasets and
dataset mutation will not be supported in <a
href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> 5.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The dataset methods created by Model#subset and Model::DatasetModule#subset
now cache the returned dataset if the current dataset is frozen, none of
the arguments are Procs, and a block is not provided.  This can result in
up to a 3x performance  improvement for method chains that use subsets,
such as:</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-constant">ModelClass</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">subset1</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">subset2</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">subset3</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">first</span></pre>
</li><li>
<p>Model::DatasetModule has had the following methods added to it: distinct,
exclude, exclude_having, grep, group, group_and_count, group_append,
having, limit, offset, order, order_append, order_prepend, select,
select_all, select_append, select_group, where, and server. These methods
create dataset methods that when called call the dataset method with the
same name on the receiver.  Example:</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-keyword">class</span> <span class="ruby-constant">ModelClass</span> <span class="ruby-operator">&lt;</span> <span class="ruby-constant">Sequel</span><span class="ruby-operator">::</span><span class="ruby-constant">Model</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-identifier">dataset_module</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">do</span>&#x000A;    <span class="ruby-identifier">select</span> <span class="ruby-value">:with_id_and_name</span>, <span class="ruby-value">:id</span>, <span class="ruby-value">:name</span>&#x000A;    <span class="ruby-identifier">where</span> <span class="ruby-value">:active</span>, <span class="ruby-value">:active</span>&#x000A;    <span class="ruby-identifier">order</span> <span class="ruby-value">:by_name</span>, <span class="ruby-value">:name</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-keyword">end</span>&#x000A;&#x000A;<span class="ruby-constant">ModelClass</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">active</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">by_name</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">with_id_and_name</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">all</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-comment"># SELECT id, name FROM model_classes WHERE active ORDER BY name</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-comment"># Equivalent to:</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-constant">ModelClass</span>.&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-identifier">where</span>(<span class="ruby-value">:active</span>).&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-identifier">order</span>(<span class="ruby-value">:name</span>).&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-identifier">select</span>(<span class="ruby-value">:id</span>, <span class="ruby-value">:name</span>).&#x000A;  <span class="ruby-identifier">all</span></pre>

<p>In addition to being easier than defining the methods manually, this also
enables caching of the datasets in most cases, so that the above method
chain does not create any additional datasets after the first call.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Dataset#with_extend now accepts a block and will create a module with that
block that will be used to extend the object, after any modules given as
arguments have been applied:</p>

<pre>DB[:table].with_extend{def foo; 1 end}.foo =&gt; 1</pre>
</li><li>
<p>The identifier mangling support for datasets (identifier_input_method and
identifier_output_method) has been moved to a identifier_mangling database
extension, but it is still loaded by default.  You can disable the loading
of this extension by using the :identifier_mangling=&gt;false Database
option.  <a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> 5 will stop
loading of this extension by default, requiring you to load it manually via
Database#extension if you need it.</p>

<p>Sequel&#39;s default remains the same as before, to convert identifiers to
uppercase on input and lowercase on output on databases that fold unquoted
identifiers to uppercase (per the SQL standard), and to not mangle
identifiers at all on databases that fold unquoted identifiers to lowercase
(MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).  The identifier_mangling extension just allows
you to change the default behavior.</p>
</li><li>
<p>On DB2, Dataset#with_convert_smallint_to_bool has been added, which returns
a modified dataset with the convert_smallint_to_bool setting changed. 
Previously, chaging the smallint_to_bool setting required mutating a
dataset.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The mock adapter now supports Dataset#with_{autoid,fetch,numrows}, allowing
mocking of results when using frozen datasets.</p>
</li></ul>

<h1 id="label-Other+Improvements">Other Improvements<span><a href="#label-Other+Improvements">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h1>
<ul><li>
<p>Using an eager load callback when eager loading a one_to_one association
that uses an order or offset now works correctly on databases that do not
support window functions.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Dataset#== and Dataset#hash are now faster as they don&#39;t need to
generate SQL.  As all internal state is now stored in the opts, it just
considers the class, db, and opts.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The prepared statement/bound variable internals were heavily refactored to
be simpler and more robust, to more easily support native prepared
statements, and to work with frozen datasets.</p>
</li><li>
<p>When emulating alter table operations on SQLite, integer primary keys now
use AUTOINCREMENT, since that is Sequel&#39;s default when creating tables
on SQLite.</p>
</li><li>
<p>On SQLite, Database#schema no longer uses :auto_increment entries when the
table has a composite primary key.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Most dataset opts values are now frozen to prevent accidental modification
and allow for thread-safe access.</p>
</li><li>
<p>SQL::Expression subclass instances are now always frozen.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Dataset::PlaceholderLiteralizer and 
Dataset::PlaceholderLiteralizer::Argument instances are now always frozen.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Dataset#ungraphed now works on a frozen model dataset.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Model#set_server now works when the model uses a frozen dataset.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The pagination and null_dataset extensions now work on frozen datasets.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Dataset#server now works for frozen model datasets when the model uses the
sharding plugin.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Calling eager_graph or association_join on a model dataset is now
deprecated if it would ignore the association&#39;s :conditions option and
the :graph_conditions, :graph_block, or :graph_only_conditions association
option is not used.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Using the :eager_limit dataset option in an eager_load callback with a
singular association now raises an Error. Previously, the behavior was
undefined.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Calling Dataset#prepare without a name argument is now deprecated. 
Previously, it raised an Error in the mysql, mysql2, and postgres adapters,
but was allowed on other adapters.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The looser_typecasting extension now handles the strict BigDecimal parsing
introduced in ruby 2.4.</p>
</li><li>
<p>When using the duplicate_columns_handler extension with
:on_duplicate_columns=&gt;:warn, the warning message is now prepend with
the file and line.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Internally, <a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> uses
Dataset#where instead of filter, reverse instead of reverse_order, and
select_append instead of select_more to save a method call and array
creation.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Dataset#db= and opts= in the sequel_3_dataset_methods extension now raise a
RuntimeError if the dataset is frozen.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Sequel&#39;s tests now run without warnings when using Minitest 5.10.</p>
</li><li>
<p><a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> now issues a deprecation
message instead of a warning when used with PostgreSQL &lt;8.2.</p>
</li></ul>

<h1 id="label-Backwards+Compatibility">Backwards Compatibility<span><a href="#label-Backwards+Compatibility">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h1>
<ul><li>
<p>Any external dataset extensions or adapters that modified or directly
accessed dataset instance variables other than @db and @opts (such as
@columns) needs to be updated to work with the new dataset internals.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Any external adapters that implemented native prepared statements/ bound
variables need to be updated to work with the new internal prepared
statement API.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Model.set_dataset and .dataset= now operate on a clone of the dataset
given, instead of mutating the dataset that is passed in. This allows them
to work with frozen datasets, but can change the behavior if you mutate a
dataset after passing it to one of these methods.  Anyone doing that needs
to change their code to get the current copy of the model&#39;s dataset,
and mutate that, or better yet, avoid mutating datasets at all.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Dataset#columns now calls columns! instead of the other way around, which
may require external plugins/extensions that override columns to switch to
overriding columns!.</p>
</li><li>
<p>External adapters that want to disable identifier mangling by default need
to be updated.</p>
