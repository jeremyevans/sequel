            <ul><li>
            <p>LATERAL subqueries are now supported on PostgreSQL 9.3+, HSQLDB, and DB2
            via Dataset#lateral:</p>
            
            <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-constant">DB</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">from</span>(:<span class="ruby-identifier">a</span>, <span class="ruby-constant">DB</span>[:<span class="ruby-identifier">b</span>].<span class="ruby-identifier">where</span>(:<span class="ruby-identifier">c=</span><span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span>:<span class="ruby-identifier">a__d</span>).<span class="ruby-identifier">lateral</span>)&#x000A;<span class="ruby-comment"># SELECT * FROM a,</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-comment"># LATERAL (SELECT * FROM b WHERE (c = a.d)) AS t1</span></pre>
            
            <p>You can use a similar syntax when joining tables:</p>
            
            <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-constant">DB</span>[:<span class="ruby-identifier">a</span>].<span class="ruby-identifier">cross_join</span>(<span class="ruby-constant">DB</span>[:<span class="ruby-identifier">b</span>].<span class="ruby-identifier">where</span>(:<span class="ruby-identifier">c=</span><span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span>:<span class="ruby-identifier">a__d</span>).<span class="ruby-identifier">lateral</span>)&#x000A;<span class="ruby-comment"># SELECT * FROM a</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-comment"># CROSS JOIN LATERAL (SELECT * FROM b WHERE (c = a.d)) AS t1</span></pre>
            
            <p>If you are using Microsoft SQL Server, you can use the new
            mssql_emulate_lateral_with_apply extension to emulate LATERAL subqueries
            via CROSS/OUTER APPLY.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The static_cache plugin now supports a :frozen=&gt;false option.  When this
            option is used, instead of returning the frozen cached values, the model
            now returns new, unfrozen objects that can be modified. Note that if you
            make any database modifications, you are responsible for updating the cache
            manually.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>A pg_static_cache_updater extension has been added.  This extension can
            automatically update the caches used by the static_cache plugin, whenever
            the underlying database table is updated, using PostgreSQL&#39;s
            notification channels.</p>
            
            <p>This works by defining triggers on the underlying model tables that use
            NOTIFY, and spinning up a thread in your application processes that uses
            LISTEN, and refreshes the cache for the related model whenever it receives
            a notification that the underlying table has been modified.</p>
            
            <p>This extension should make it possible to use the static_cache plugin with
            the :frozen=&gt;false option for any table that is small and not frequently
            updated.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>A from_block extension has been added that makes Database#from operate like
            Dataset#from in regards to a passed block, allowing you to write code like:</p>
            
            <pre>DB.from{table_returning_function(arg1, arg2)}</pre>
            </li><li>
            <p>Database#supports_partial_indexes? has been added for checking for partial
            index support.  Partial indexes are now supported on SQLite 3.8.0+.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>A pg_loose_count extension has been added for fast approximate counts of
            PostgreSQL tables.  This uses the system tables and should be fairly
            accurate if the table statistics are up to date:</p>
            
            <pre>DB.loose_count(:table)</pre>
            </li><li>
            <p>The Dataset#use_cursor method in the postgres adapter now supports a
            :cursor_name option.  You can set this option if you want to use nested
            cursors.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The mysql2 adapter now supports a :flags Database option allowing to set
            custom mysql2 flags (e.g. ::Mysql2::Client::MULTI_STATEMENTS).</p>
            </li></ul>
            
            <h1 id="label-Other+Improvements">Other Improvements</h1>
            <ul><li>
            <p>Dataset#freeze has been implemented.  Previously, it was not implemented,
            so Object#freeze was used, which resulted in a dataset that wasn&#39;t
            cloneable.  Dataset#freeze now works as expected, resulting in a cloneable
            dataset, but it doesn&#39;t allow methods to be called that mutate the
            receiver.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Dataset#dup has been implemented.  Previously, it was not implemented, so
            Object#dup was used, which resulted in a dataset that shared an options
            hash with the receiver, so modifying the dup&#39;s opts could also change
            the original dataset. Now dup works similarly to clone, except that the
            returned object will not be frozen.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Model#dup has been implemented.  Previously, it was not implemented, so
            Object#dup was used, which resulted in a model instance that shared the
            values hash with the receiver, so modifying the dup&#39;s values also
            changed the original&#39;s values.  Now, dup does a shallow copy of some of
            the internal data structures as well, so the copy is more independent.</p>
            
            <p>Note that you still need to be careful if you mutate objects:</p>
            
            <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-identifier">m</span> = <span class="ruby-constant">Model</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">new</span>(:<span class="ruby-identifier">a=</span><span class="ruby-operator">&gt;</span><span class="ruby-string">&#39;a&#39;</span>)&#x000A;<span class="ruby-identifier">m2</span> = <span class="ruby-identifier">m</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">dup</span>&#x000A;<span class="ruby-identifier">m</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">a</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">gsub!</span>(<span class="ruby-string">&#39;a&#39;</span>, <span class="ruby-string">&#39;b&#39;</span>) <span class="ruby-comment"># also changes m2</span></pre>
            </li><li>
            <p>Model#clone has been implemented.  Previously, it had the same issues as
            dup.  Now, it calls the new Model#dup, but also freezes the returned object
            if the receiver is frozen.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Placeholder literal strings with an empty parameter hash are now handled
            correctly.</p>
            </li></ul>
            
            <h1 id="label-Backwards+Compatibility">Backwards Compatibility</h1>
            <ul><li>
            <p>The static_cache plugin now disallows saving/destroying instances unless
            the :frozen=&gt;false option is used.  As the cached objects returned by
            the model were frozen anyway, this affects creating new instances or
            saving/destroying instances returned from the underlying dataset.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Model#set_values has been removed (it was deprecated starting in <a
            href="../../../classes/Sequel.html">Sequel</a> 4.0).</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>The following Model class methods are no longer defined: insert_multiple,
            set, to_csv, paginate, query, set_overrides, set_defaults.  By default,
            these methods used call the dataset method of the same name, but as those
            methods are no longer defined on datasets by default, they also resulted in
            a NoMethodError.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Dataset#query!, set_defaults!, and set_overrides! are no longer defined on
            all datasets.  They are now only defined on datasets that use the query or
            set_overrides extensions.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Partial indexes are no longer returned by Database#indexes on MSSQL, for
            consistency with PostgreSQL.  Note that the same change was desired for
            SQLite, but SQLite currently does not offer reflection support for
            determining which indexes are partial.</p>
            </li><li>
            <p>Database#foreign_key_list on MSSQL now will return a
            SQL::QualifiedIdentifier instead of a symbol for the :table entry if the
            schema of the referenced table does not match the schema of the referencing
            table.</p>
