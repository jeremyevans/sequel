<h1 id="label-New+Features">New Features<span><a href="#label-New+Features">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h1>
<ul><li>
<p>A tinytds adapter was added, enabling <a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html"><code>Sequel</code></a> users on a C-based ruby running on *nix easy access to Microsoft SQL Server. Previously, the best way to connect to Microsoft SQL Server from a C-based ruby on *nix was to use the ODBC adapter with unixodbc and freetds.  However, setting that up is nontrivial, while setting up tinytds is very easy.</p>

<p>Note that the tinytds adapter currently requires the git master branch of tiny_tds, but tiny_tds 0.4.0 should include the related changes.</p>
</li><li>
<p>An association_autoreloading plugin has been added to <a href="../../../classes/Sequel.html"><code>Sequel</code></a>, which removes stale many_to_one associations from the cache when the associated foreign key setter is used to change the value of the foreign key.</p>
</li><li>
<p>bin/sequel now operates more like a standard *nix utility. If given a file on the command line after the connection string, it will assume that file has ruby code and load it. If stdin is not a tty, it will read from stdin and execute it as ruby code.</p>

<p>For recent Linux users, this means you can have a shebang line such as:</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-comment">#!/usr/bin/sequel postgres://user:pass@host/db</span>
</pre>

<p>to create a self contained script.</p>
</li><li>
<p>bin/sequel now supports -r and -I options similar to ruby’s -r and -I options.</p>
</li><li>
<p>MySQL datasets now have a calc_found_rows method that uses SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS, which provides a fast way to limit the number of results returned by a dataset while having an easy way to determine how many rows would have been returned if no limit was applied.</p>
</li></ul>

<h1 id="label-Other+Improvements">Other Improvements<span><a href="#label-Other+Improvements">&para;</a> <a href="#top">&uarr;</a></span></h1>
<ul><li>
<p>The Sequel::Model.plugin method can now be overridden just like any other method.  Previously, it was the only method that was defined directly on the class.  This allows the creation of plugins that can modify the plugin system itself.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Symbol splitting (:table__column___alias) now works correctly for identifiers that include characters that aren’t in [w ]. Among other things, this means that identifiers with accented characters or even kanji characters can be used with symbol splitting.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If cover? is defined, it is now used in preference to include? for the validates_includes/validates_inclusion_of validations. ruby 1.9 defines include? differently for some ranges and can be very slow, while cover? is similar to the 1.8 behavior of just checking the beginning and end of the range.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The bin/sequel -L option now takes effect even if the -m, -C, -d, or -D options are used.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The schema_dumper extension now recognizes the “bigint unsigned” type.</p>
</li><li>
<p>On Microsoft SQL Server, if joining to a subselect that uses a common table expression, that common table expression is promoted to the main dataset.  This allows most queries to work correctly, but is vulnerable to issues if both the current dataset and the joined dataset use common table expressions with the same name.  Unfortunately, unlike PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server does not allow common table expressions to occur in subselects.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The NULL/NOT NULL, DEFAULT, and UNIQUE column options now use the proper order on H2 and Oracle, so they can now be used in conjunction with each other.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Row locks are now enabled on Oracle.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The join_table method on MySQL no longer ignores the block it was given.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The informix adapter now supports ruby-informix version &gt;= 0.7.3, while still being backwards compatible with older versions.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The specs now run under both RSpec 2 and RSpec 1.</p>
