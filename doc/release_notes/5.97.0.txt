= New Features

* A deprecated_associations plugin has been added, which supports
  warning if a deprecated association is used:

    Album.plugin :deprecated_associations
    Album.many_to_one :artist, deprecated: true
    album = Album[1]

    # Warnings for all of the following calls
    album.artist
    album.artist_dataset
    album.artist = Artist[2]
    Album.association_reflection(:artist)
    Album.eager(:artist)
    Album.eager_graph(:artist)
    Album.where(artist: Artist[1]).all

  You can customize the behavior using the :raise, :deduplicate,
  and :backtrace plugin options.

* Database#rename_schema has been added on PostgreSQL to support
  renaming schemas.

= Other Improvements

* Database#drop_schema on PostgreSQL now clears all cached schema
  information.

* Postgres::PGRange#inspect in the pg_range extension now provides
  more friendly output:

    Sequel::Postgres::PGRange.from_range(1...3, :int4).inspect
    # => "#<Sequel::Postgres::PGRange [1,3)::int4>"

* BigDecimal typcasting when using the looser_typecasting extension
  now works as expected when using newer bigdecimal gem with
  Ruby < 2.4.
