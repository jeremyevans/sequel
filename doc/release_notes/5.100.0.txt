= New Features

* A single_statement_dataset_destroy plugin has been added. This
  plugin will run the before_destroy hooks for all instances, then run
  a DELETE statement on the dataset, then run the after_destroy hooks
  for all instances. However, this optimized form will not be used if
  the model uses a custom around_destroy hook.

* The set_column_type schema modification method now supports a
  :collate option on PostgreSQL 9.1+ and MySQL.

= Other Improvements

* The unused_associations plugin no longer reports associations with
  the :is_used option as unused. Previously, the :is_used option only
  disabled changes by the :modify_associations plugin option.

* Postgres::PGRange#to_s is now an alias of #inspect, so it also uses 
  the friendly inspect output added in 5.97.0.
