= New Features

* The swift adapter now supports an SQLite subadapter.  Use the
  :db_type => 'sqlite' option when connecting.  You can use an
  in memory database with the following connection string:
  
    swift:///?database=:memory:&db_type=sqlite

* Arbitrary JDBC properties can now be set in the JDBC adapter
  using the :jdbc_properties option when connecting.  The value
  of this option should be a hash where keys and values are JDBC
  property keys and values.
  
* Basic Microsoft Access support was added to the ado adapter.
  The creation of autoincrementing primary key integers now works,
  and identifiers are now quoted with [].

* The Database#indexes method now supports a :partial option when
  connecting to MySQL, which makes it include partial indexes (which
  are usually excluded).

= Other Improvements

* The class_table_inheritance plugin now handles subclass
  associations better.  Previously, the implicit eager loading code
  had issues when you called an association method that only existed
  in the subclass.

* The error message used when a validates_max_length validation is
  applied to a nil column value has been improved.  You can override
  the message yourself using the :nil_message option.
  
* The read_timeout and connect_timeout options now work correctly in
  the mysql adapter.

* Another MySQL disconnect error message is now recognized.

= Backwards Compatibility

* The swift adapter was upgraded to support swift 0.8.1.  Older
  versions of swift are no longer supported.
