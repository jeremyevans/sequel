    # The update_primary_key plugin allows you to modify an object's
    # primary key and then save the record.  Sequel does not work
    # correctly with primary key modifications by default.  Sequel
    # is designed to work with surrogate primary keys that never need to be
    # modified, but this plugin makes it work correctly with natural
    # primary keys that may need to be modified. Example:
    #
    #   album = Album[1]
    #   album.id = 2
    #   album.save
    #
    # Usage:
    #
    #   # Make all model subclasses support primary key updates
    #   # (called before loading subclasses)
    #   Sequel::Model.plugin :update_primary_key
    #
    #   # Make the Album class support primary key updates
    #   Album.plugin :update_primary_key
