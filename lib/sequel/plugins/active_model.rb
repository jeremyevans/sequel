    # The ActiveModel plugin makes Sequel::Model objects
    # pass the ActiveModel::Lint tests, which should
    # hopefully mean full ActiveModel compliance.  This should
    # allow the full support of Sequel::Model objects in Rails 3.
    # This plugin requires active_model in order to use
    # ActiveModel::Naming.
    #
    # Usage:
    #
    #   # Make all subclasses active_model compliant (called before loading subclasses)
    #   Sequel::Model.plugin :active_model
    #
    #   # Make the Album class active_model compliant
    #   Album.plugin :active_model
