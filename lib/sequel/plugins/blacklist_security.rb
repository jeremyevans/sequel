    # The blacklist_security plugin contains blacklist-based support for
    # mass assignment, specifying which columns to not allow mass assignment for,
    # implicitly allowing mass assignment for columns not listed.  This is only
    # for backwards compatibility, it should not be used by new code.
    #
    # Usage:
    #
    #   # Make all model subclasses support the blacklist security features.
    #   Sequel::Model.plugin :blacklist_security
    #
    #   # Make the Album class support the blacklist security features.
    #   Album.plugin :blacklist_security

        # Set the columns to restrict when using mass assignment (e.g. +set+).  Using this means that
