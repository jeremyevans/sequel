    # Sequel's built-in hook class methods plugin is designed for backwards
    # compatibility.  Its use is not encouraged, it is recommended to use
    # instance methods and super instead of this plugin.  What this plugin
    # allows you to do is, for example:
    #
    #   # Block only, can cause duplicate hooks if code is reloaded
    #   before_save{self.created_at = Time.now}
    #   # Block with tag, safe for reloading
    #   before_save(:set_created_at){self.created_at = Time.now}
    #   # Tag only, safe for reloading, calls instance method
    #   before_save(:set_created_at)
    #
    # Pretty much anything you can do with a hook class method, you can also
    # do with an instance method instead:
    #
    #    def before_save
    #      return false if super == false
    #      self.created_at = Time.now
    #    end
    #
    # Note that returning false in any before hook block will skip further
    # before hooks and abort the action.  So if a before_save hook block returns
    # false, future before_save hook blocks are not called, and the save is aborted.
    #
    # Usage:
    #
    #   # Allow use of hook class methods in all model subclasses (called before loading subclasses)
    #   Sequel::Model.plugin :hook_class_methods
    #
    #   # Allow the use of hook class methods in the Album class
    #   Album.plugin :hook_class_methods
    module HookClassMethods
      # Set up the hooks instance variable in the model.
      def self.apply(model)
        hooks = model.instance_variable_set(:@hooks, {})
        Model::HOOKS.each{|h| hooks[h] = []}
      end

      module ClassMethods
        Model::HOOKS.each{|h| class_eval("def #{h}(method = nil, &block); add_hook(:#{h}, method, &block) end", __FILE__, __LINE__)}

        # This adds a new hook type. It will define both a class
        # method that you can use to add hooks, as well as an instance method
        # that you can use to call all hooks of that type.  The class method
        # can be called with a symbol or a block or both.  If a block is given and
        # and symbol is not, it adds the hook block to the hook type.  If a block
        # and symbol are both given, it replaces the hook block associated with
        # that symbol for a given hook type, or adds it if there is no hook block
        # with that symbol for that hook type.  If no block is given, it assumes
        # the symbol specifies an instance method to call and adds it to the hook
        # type.
        #
        # If any before hook block returns false, the instance method will return false
        # immediately without running the rest of the hooks of that type.
        #
        # It is recommended that you always provide a symbol to this method,
        # for descriptive purposes.  It's only necessary to do so when you
        # are using a system that reloads code.
        #
        # Example of usage:
        #
        #  class MyModel
        #   define_hook :before_move_to
        #   before_move_to(:check_move_allowed){|o| o.allow_move?}
        #   def move_to(there)
        #     return if before_move_to == false
        #     # move MyModel object to there
        #   end
        #  end
