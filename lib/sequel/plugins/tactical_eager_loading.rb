    # The tactical_eager_loading plugin allows you to eagerly load
    # an association for all objects retrieved from the same dataset
    # without calling +eager+ on the dataset.  If you attempt to load
    # associated objects for a record and the association for that
    # object is currently not cached, it assumes you want to get
    # the associated objects for all objects retrieved with the dataset that
    # retrieved the current object.
    #
    # Tactical eager loading only takes affect if you retrieved the
    # current object with Dataset#all, it doesn't work if you
    # retrieved the current object with Dataset#each.
    #
    # Basically, this allows the following code to issue only two queries:
    #
    #   Album.where{id<100}.all do |a|
    #     a.artists
    #   end
    #   # SELECT * FROM albums WHERE (id < 100)
    #   # SELECT * FROM artists WHERE id IN (...)
    #
    # Note that if you are passing a callback to the association method via
    # a block or :callback option, or using the :reload option to reload
    # the association, eager loading will not be done.
    #
    # You can use the :eager_reload option to reload the association for all
    # objects that the current object was retrieved with:
    #
    #   # SELECT * FROM albums WHERE (id < 100)
    #   albums = Album.where{id<100}.all
    #
    #   # Eagerly load all artists for these albums
    #   # SELECT * FROM artists WHERE id IN (...)
    #   albums.first.artists
    #
    #   # Do something that may affect which artists are associated to the albums
    #
    #   # Eagerly reload all artists for these albums
    #   # SELECT * FROM artists WHERE id IN (...)
    #   albums.first.artists(eager_reload: true)
    # 
    # You can also use the :eager option to specify dependent associations
    # to eager load:
    #
    #  albums = Album.where{id<100}.all
    #
    #   # Eager load all artists for these albums, and all albums for those artists
    #   # SELECT * FROM artists WHERE id IN (...)
    #   # SELECT * FROM albums WHERE artist_id IN (...)
    #   albums.first.artists(eager: :albums)
    #
    # You can also use :eager to specify an eager callback. For example:
    #
    #   albums = Album.where{id<100}.all
    #
    #   # Eagerly load all artists whose name starts with A-M for these albums
    #   # SELECT * FROM artists WHERE name > 'N' AND id IN (...)
    #   albums.first.artists(eager: lambda{|ds| ds.where(Sequel[:name] > 'N')})
    #
    # Note that the :eager option only takes effect if the association
    # has not already been loaded for the model.
    #
    # The tactical_eager_loading plugin also allows transparent eager
    # loading when calling association methods on associated objects
    # eagerly loaded via Dataset#eager_graph.  This can reduce N queries
    # to a single query when iterating over all associated objects.
    # Consider the following code:
    #
    #   artists = Artist.eager_graph(:albums).all
    #   artists.each do |artist|
    #     artist.albums.each do |album|
    #       album.tracks
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # By default this will issue a single query to load the artists and
    # albums, and then one query for each album to load the tracks for
    # the album:
    #
    #   # SELECT artists.id, ...
    #            albums.id, ...
    #   # FROM artists
    #   # LEFT OUTER JOIN albums ON (albums.artist_id = artists.id);
    #   # SELECT * FROM tracks WHERE album_id = 1;
    #   # SELECT * FROM tracks WHERE album_id = 2;
    #   # SELECT * FROM tracks WHERE album_id = 10;
    #   # ...
    #
    # With the tactical_eager_loading plugin, this uses the same
    # query to load the artists and albums, but then issues a single query
    # to load the tracks for all albums.
    #
    #   # SELECT artists.id, ...
    #            albums.id, ...
    #   # FROM artists
    #   # LEFT OUTER JOIN albums ON (albums.artist_id = artists.id);
    #   # SELECT * FROM tracks WHERE (tracks.album_id IN (1, 2, 10, ...));
    #
    # Note that transparent eager loading for associated objects
    # loaded by eager_graph will only take place if the associated classes
    # also use the tactical_eager_loading plugin.
    #
    # When using this plugin, calling association methods on separate
    # instances of the same result set is not thread-safe, because this
    # plugin attempts to modify all instances of the same result set
    # to eagerly set the associated objects, and having separate threads
    # modify the same model instance is not thread-safe.
    #
    # Because this plugin will automatically use eager loading for
    # performance, it can break code that defines associations that
    # do not support eager loading, without marking that they do not
    # support eager loading via the <tt>allow_eager: false</tt> option.
    # Make sure to set <tt>allow_eager: false</tt> on any association
    # used with this plugin if the association doesn't support eager loading.
    #
    # Usage:
    #
    #   # Make all model subclass instances use tactical eager loading (called before loading subclasses)
    #   Sequel::Model.plugin :tactical_eager_loading
    #
    #   # Make the Album class use tactical eager loading
    #   Album.plugin :tactical_eager_loading
