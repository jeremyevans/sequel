    # The paged_operations plugin adds +paged_update+ and
    # +paged_delete+ dataset methods.  These behave similarly to
    # the default +update+ and +delete+ dataset methods, except
    # that the update or deletion is done in potentially multiple
    # queries (by default, affecting 1000 rows per query).
    # For a large table, this prevents the change from
    # locking the table for a long period of time.
    #
    # Because the point of this is to prevent locking tables for
    # long periods of time, the separate queries are not contained
    # in a transaction, which means if a later query fails,
    # earlier queries will still be committed.  You could prevent
    # this by using a transaction manually, but that defeats the
    # purpose of using these methods.
    #
    # Examples:
    #
    #   Album.where{name <= 'M'}.paged_update(updated_at: Sequel::CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
    #   # SELECT id FROM albums WHERE (name <= 'M') ORDER BY id LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1000
    #   # UPDATE albums SET updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE ((name <= 'M') AND ("id" < 1002))
    #   # SELECT id FROM albums WHERE ((name <= 'M') AND (id >= 1002)) ORDER BY id LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1000
    #   # UPDATE albums SET updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE ((name <= 'M') AND ("id" < 2002) AND (id >= 1002))
    #   # ...
    #   # SELECT id FROM albums WHERE ((name <= 'M') AND (id >= 10002)) ORDER BY id LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1000
    #   # UPDATE albums SET updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE ((name <= 'M') AND (id >= 10002))
    #
    #   Album.where{name > 'M'}.paged_delete
    #   # SELECT id FROM albums WHERE (name > 'M') ORDER BY id LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1000
    #   # DELETE FROM albums WHERE ((name > 'M') AND (id < 1002))
    #   # SELECT id FROM albums WHERE (name > 'M') ORDER BY id LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1000
    #   # DELETE FROM albums WHERE ((name > 'M') AND (id < 2002))
    #   # ...
    #   # SELECT id FROM albums WHERE (name > 'M') ORDER BY id LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1000
    #   # DELETE FROM albums WHERE (name > 'M')
    #
    # The plugin also adds a +paged_datasets+ method that will yield
    # separate datasets limited in size that in total handle all
    # rows in the receiver:
    #
    #   Album.where{name > 'M'}.paged_datasets{|ds| puts ds.sql}
    #   # Runs: SELECT id FROM albums WHERE (name <= 'M') ORDER BY id LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1000
    #   # Prints: SELECT * FROM albums WHERE ((name <= 'M') AND ("id" < 1002))
    #   # Runs: SELECT id FROM albums WHERE ((name <= 'M') AND (id >= 1002)) ORDER BY id LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1000
    #   # Prints: SELECT * FROM albums WHERE ((name <= 'M') AND ("id" < 2002) AND (id >= 1002))
    #   # ...
    #   # Runs: SELECT id FROM albums WHERE ((name <= 'M') AND (id >= 10002)) ORDER BY id LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1000
    #   # Prints: SELECT * FROM albums WHERE ((name <= 'M') AND (id >= 10002))
    #
    # To set the number of rows per page, pass a :rows_per_page option:
    #
    #   Album.where{name <= 'M'}.paged_update({x: Sequel[:x] + 1}, rows_per_page: 4)
    #   # SELECT id FROM albums WHERE (name <= 'M') ORDER BY id LIMIT 1 OFFSET 4
    #   # UPDATE albums SET x = x + 1 WHERE ((name <= 'M') AND ("id" < 5))
    #   # SELECT id FROM albums WHERE ((name <= 'M') AND (id >= 5)) ORDER BY id LIMIT 1 OFFSET 4
    #   # UPDATE albums SET x = x + 1 WHERE ((name <= 'M') AND ("id" < 9) AND (id >= 5))
    #   # ...
    #   # SELECT id FROM albums WHERE ((name <= 'M') AND (id >= 12345)) ORDER BY id LIMIT 1 OFFSET 4
    #   # UPDATE albums SET x = x + 1 WHERE ((name <= 'M') AND (id >= 12345))
    # 
    # You should avoid using +paged_update+ or +paged_datasets+
    # with updates that modify the primary key, as such usage is
    # not supported by this plugin.
    #
    # This plugin only supports models with scalar primary keys.
    #
    # Usage:
    #
    #   # Make all model subclasses support paged update/delete/datasets
    #   # (called before loading subclasses)
    #   Sequel::Model.plugin :paged_operations
    #
    #   # Make the Album class support paged update/delete/datasets
    #   Album.plugin :paged_operations
