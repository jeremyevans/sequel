    # The instance_hooks plugin allows you to add hooks to specific instances,
    # by passing a block to a _hook method (e.g. before_save_hook{do_something}).
    # The block is executed when the hook is called (e.g. before_save).
    #
    # All of the standard hooks are supported, except for after_initialize.
    # Instance level before hooks are executed in reverse order of addition before
    # calling super.  Instance level after hooks are executed in order of addition
    # after calling super.  If any of the instance level before hook blocks return
    # false, no more instance level before hooks are called and false is returned.
    #
    # Instance level hooks for before and after are cleared after all related
    # after level instance hooks have run.  This means that if you add a before_create
    # and before_update instance hooks to a new object, the before_create hook will
    # be run the first time you save the object (creating it), and the before_update
    # hook will be run the second time you save the object (updating it), and no
    # hooks will be run the third time you save the object.
    #
    # Usage:
    #
    #   # Add the instance hook methods to all model subclass instances (called before loading subclasses)
    #   Sequel::Model.plugin :instance_hooks
    #
    #   # Add the instance hook methods just to Album instances
    #   Album.plugin :instance_hooks
