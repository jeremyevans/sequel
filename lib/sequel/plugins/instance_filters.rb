    # This plugin allows you to add filters on a per object basis that
    # restrict updating or deleting the object.  It's designed for cases
    # where you would normally have to drop down to the dataset level
    # to get the necessary control, because you only want to delete or
    # update the rows in certain cases based on the current status of
    # the row in the database.
    #

    #   # database row. 
    #   i1 = Item.first(:id=>1, :delete_allowed=>false)
    #   i2 = Item.first(:id=>1, :delete_allowed=>false)
    #
    #   # Add an instance filter to the object. This filter is in effect
    #   # until the object is successfully updated or deleted.
    #   i1.instance_filter(:delete_allowed=>true)
    #
    #   # Attempting to delete the object where the filter doesn't
    #   # match any rows raises an error.
    #   i1.delete # raises Sequel::NoExistingObject
    #
    #   # The other object that represents the same row has no
    #   # instance filters, and can be updated normally.
    #   i2.update(:delete_allowed=>true)
    #
    #   # Even though the filter is now still in effect, since the
    #   # database row has been updated to allow deleting,
    #   # delete now works.
