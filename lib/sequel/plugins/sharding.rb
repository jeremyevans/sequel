    # The sharding plugin augments Sequel's default model sharding support
    # in the following ways:
    #
    # * It automatically sets model instances to be saved back to the
    #   shard they were retreived from.
    # * It makes model associations use the same shard as the model
    #   object.
    # * It adds a slightly nicer API for creating model instances on
    #   specific shards.
    # 
    # Usage:
    #
    #   # Add the sharding support to all model subclasses (called before loading subclasses)
    #   Sequel::Model.plugin :sharding
    #
    #   # Add the sharding support to the Album class
    #   Album.plugin :sharding
