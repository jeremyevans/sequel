    # This is a fairly simple plugin that modifies the internal association loading logic
    # for many_to_one associations to use a simple primary key lookup on the associated
    # class, which is generally faster as it uses mostly static SQL.  Additional, if the
    # associated class is caching primary key lookups, you get the benefit of a cached
    # lookup.
    #
    # This plugin is generally not as fast as the prepared_statements_associations plugin
    # in the case where the model is not caching primary key lookups, however, it is
    # probably significantly faster if the model is caching primary key lookups.  If
    # the prepared_statements_associations plugin has been loaded first, this
    # plugin will only use the primary key lookup code if the associated model is
    # caching primary key lookups.
    #
    # This plugin attempts to determine cases where the primary key lookup would have
    # different results than the regular lookup, and use the regular lookup in that case,
    # but it cannot handle all situations correctly, which is why it is not Sequel's
    # default behavior.
    #
    # You can disable primary key lookups on a per association basis with this
    # plugin using the :many_to_one_pk_lookup=>false association option.
    #
    # Usage:
    #
    #   # Make all model subclass instances use primary key lookups for many_to_one
    #   # association loading
    #   Sequel::Model.plugin :many_to_one_pk_lookup
    #
    #   # Do so for just the album class.
    #   Album.plugin :many_to_one_pk_lookup
