    # The identity_map plugin allows the user to create temporary identity maps
    # via the with_identity_map method, which takes a block.  Inside the block,
    # objects have a 1-1 correspondence with rows in the database.
    #
    # For example, the following is true, and wouldn't be true if you weren't
    # using the identity map:
    #   Sequel::Model.with_identity_map do
    #     Album.filter{(id > 0) & (id < 2)}.first.object_id == Album.first(:id=>1).object_id
    #   end
    #
    # In addition to providing a 1-1 correspondence, the identity_map plugin
    # also provides a cached looked up of records in two cases:
    # * Model.[] (e.g. Album[1])
    # * Model.many_to_one accessor methods (e.g. album.artist)
    #
    # If the object you are looking up, using one of those two methods, is already
    # in the identity map, the record is returned without a database query being
    # issued.
    #
    # Identity maps are thread-local and only persist for the duration of the block,
    # so they should only be considered as a possible performance enhancer.
    #
    # The identity_map plugin is not compatible with the standard eager loading of
    # many_to_many and many_through_many associations.  If you want to use the identity_map plugin,
    # you should use +eager_graph+ instead of +eager+ for those associations. It is also
    # not compatible with the eager loading in the +rcte_tree+ plugin.
    #
    # Usage:
    #
    #   # Use an identity map that will affect all model classes (called before loading subclasses)
    #   Sequel::Model.plugin :identity_map
    #
    #   # Use an identity map just for the Album class
    #   Album.plugin :identity_map
    #   # would need to do Album.with_identity_map{} to use the identity map
