# This extension adds a statement cache to Sequel's postgres adapter,
# with the ability to automatically prepare statements that are
# executed repeatedly.  When combined with the pg_auto_parameterize
# extension, it can take Sequel code such as:
#
#   DB.extension :pg_auto_parameterize, :pg_statement_cache
#   DB[:table].filter(:a=>1)
#   DB[:table].filter(:a=>2)
#   DB[:table].filter(:a=>3)
#
# And use the same prepared statement to execute the queries.
#
# The backbone of this extension is a modified LRU cache.  It considers
# both the last executed time and the number of executions when
# determining which queries to keep in the cache.  It only cleans the
# cache when a high water mark has been passed, and removes queries
# until it reaches the low water mark, in order to avoid thrashing when
# you are using more than the maximum number of queries.  To avoid
# preparing queries when it isn't necessary, it does not prepare them
# on the server side unless they are being executed more than once.
# The cache is very tunable, allowing you to set the high and low
# water marks, the number of executions before preparing the query,
# and even use a custom callback for determine which queries to keep
# in the cache.
#
# Note that automatically preparing statements does have some issues.
# Most notably, if you change the result type that the query returns,
# PostgreSQL will raise an error.  This can happen if you have
# prepared a statement that selects all columns from a table, and then
# you add or remove a column from that table.  This extension does
# attempt to check that case and clear the statement caches if you use
# alter_table from within Sequel, but it cannot fix the case when such
# a change is made externally.
#
# This extension only works when the pg driver is used as the backend
# for the postgres adapter.

        #              equal to the maximum size, the cache is cleaned up to

        #              number.  Note that there could be fewer than this
        #              number of entries in the cache.  Defaults to :max_size/2.

        #              the query server-side.  If set to 1, prepares all executed
        #              queries server-side.  If set to 5, does not attempt to
        #              prepare the query until the 5th execution.  Defaults to 2.
        # :sorter :: A callable object that takes two arguments, the current time
        #            and the related Statement instance, and should return some
        #            Comparable (usually a numeric) such that the lowest values
