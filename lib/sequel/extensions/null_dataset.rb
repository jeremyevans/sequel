# The null_dataset extension adds the Dataset#nullify method, which
# returns a cloned dataset that will never issue a query to the
# database.  It implements the null object pattern for datasets.
#
# The most common usage is probably in a method that must return
# a dataset, where the method knows the dataset shouldn't return
# anything.  With standard Sequel, you'd probably just add a
# WHERE condition that is always false, but that still results
# in a query being sent to the database, and can be overridden
# using #unfiltered, the OR operator, or a UNION.
#
# Usage:
#
#   ds = DB[:items].nullify.where(:a=>:b).select(:c)
#   ds.sql # => "SELECT c FROM items WHERE (a = b)"
#   ds.all # => [] # no query sent to the database
#
# Note that there is one case where a null dataset will sent
# a query to the database.  If you call #columns on a nulled
# dataset and the dataset doesn't have an already cached
# version of the columns, it will create a new dataset with
# the same options to get the columns.
#
# This extension uses Object#extend at runtime, which can hurt performance.
#
# To add the nullify method to a single dataset:
#
#   ds = ds.extension(:null_dataset)
#
# To add the nullify method to all datasets on a single database:
#
#   DB.extension(:null_dataset)
