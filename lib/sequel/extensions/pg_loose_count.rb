# The pg_loose_count extension looks at the table statistics
# in the PostgreSQL system tables to get a fast approximate
# count of the number of rows in a given table:
#
#   DB.loose_count(:table) # => 123456
#
# It can also support schema qualified tables:
#
#   DB.loose_count(:schema__table) # => 123456
#
# How accurate this count is depends on the number of rows
# added/deleted from the table since the last time it was
# analyzed.
# 
# To load the extension into the database:
#
#   DB.extension :pg_loose_count

#
module Sequel
  module Postgres
    module LooseCount
      # Look at the table statistics for the given table to get
      # an approximate count of the number of rows.
