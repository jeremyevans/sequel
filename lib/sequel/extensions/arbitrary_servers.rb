# The arbitrary_servers extension allows you to connect to arbitrary
# servers/shards that were not defined when you created the database.
# To use it, you first load the extension into the Database object:
#
#   DB.extension :arbitrary_servers
#
# Then you can pass arbitrary connection options for the server/shard
# to use as a hash:
#
#   DB[:table].server(:host=>'...', :database=>'...').all
#
# Because Sequel can never be sure that the connection will be reused,
# arbitrary connections are disconnected as soon as the outermost block
# that uses them exits.  So this example uses the same connection:
#
#   DB.transaction(:server=>{:host=>'...', :database=>'...'}) do |c|
#     DB.transaction(:server=>{:host=>'...', :database=>'...'}) do |c2|
#       # c == c2
#     end
#   end
#
# But this example does not:
#
#   DB.transaction(:server=>{:host=>'...', :database=>'...'}) do |c|
#   end
#   DB.transaction(:server=>{:host=>'...', :database=>'...'}) do |c2|
#     # c != c2
#   end
#
# You can use this extension in conjunction with the server_block
# extension:
#
#   DB.with_server(:host=>'...', :database=>'...') do
#     DB.synchronize do
#       # All of these use the host/database given to with_server
#       DB[:table].insert(:c=>1)
#       DB[:table].update(:c=>2)
#       DB.tables
#       DB[:table].all
#     end
#   end
#
# Anyone using this extension in conjunction with the server_block
# extension may want to do the following to so that you don't need
# to call synchronize separately:
#
#   def DB.with_server(*)
#     super{synchronize{yield}}
#   end
#
# Note that this extension only works with the sharded threaded connection
# pool.  If you are using the sharded single connection pool, you need
# to switch to the sharded threaded connection pool before using this
# extension.
