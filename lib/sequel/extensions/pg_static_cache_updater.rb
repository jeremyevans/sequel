# The pg_static_cache_updater extension is designed to
# automatically update the caches in the models using the
# static_cache plugin when changes to the underlying tables
# are detected.
#
# Before using the extension in production, you have to add
# triggers to the tables for the classes where you want the
# caches updated automatically.  You would generally do this
# during a migration:
#
#   Sequel.migration do
#     up do
#       extension :pg_static_cache_updater
#       create_static_cache_update_function
#       create_static_cache_update_trigger(:table_1)
#       create_static_cache_update_trigger(:table_2)
#     end
#     down do
#       extension :pg_static_cache_updater
#       drop_trigger(:table_2, default_static_cache_update_name)
#       drop_trigger(:table_1, default_static_cache_update_name)
#       drop_function(default_static_cache_update_name)
#     end
#   end
#
# After the triggers have been added, in your application process,
# after setting up your models, you need to listen for changes to
# the underlying tables:
#
#   class Model1 < Sequel::Model(:table_1)
#     plugin :static_cache
#   end
#   class Model2 < Sequel::Model(:table_2)
#     plugin :static_cache
#   end
#
#   DB.extension :pg_static_cache_updater
#   DB.listen_for_static_cache_updates([Model1, Model2])
#
# When an INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE happens on the underlying table,
# the trigger will send a notification with the table's OID.
# The application(s) listening on that channel will receive
# the notification, check the oid to see if it matches one
# for the model tables it is interested in, and tell that model
# to reload the cache if there is a match.
#
# Note that listen_for_static_cache_updates spawns a new thread
# which will reserve its own database connection.  This thread
# runs until the application process is shutdown.
#
# Also note that PostgreSQL does not send notifications to
# channels until after the transaction including the changes
# is committed.  Also, because a separate thread is used to
# listen for notifications, there may be a slight delay between
# when the transaction is committed and when the cache is
# reloaded.
#
# Requirements:
# * PostgreSQL 9.0+
# * Listening Database object must be using the postgres adapter
#   with the pg driver (the model classes do not have to
#   use the same Database).
# * Must be using a thread-safe connection pool (the default).
