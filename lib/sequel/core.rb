# Top level module for Sequel
#
# There are some module methods that are added via metaprogramming, one for
# each supported adapter.  For example:
#
#   DB = Sequel.sqlite # Memory database
#   DB = Sequel.sqlite('blog.db')
#   DB = Sequel.postgres('database_name', :user=>'user',
#          :password=>'password', :host=>'host', :port=>5432,
#          :max_connections=>10)
#
# If a block is given to these methods, it is passed the opened Database
# object, which is closed (disconnected) when the block exits, just
# like a block passed to connect.  For example:
#
#   Sequel.sqlite('blog.db'){|db| puts db[:users].count}
#
# Sequel currently adds methods to the Array, Hash, String and Symbol classes by
# default.  You can either require 'sequel/no_core_ext' or set the
# +SEQUEL_NO_CORE_EXTENSIONS+ constant or environment variable before requiring
# sequel to have # Sequel not add methods to those classes.
#
# For a more expanded introduction, see the {README}[link:files/README_rdoc.html].
# For a quicker introduction, see the {cheat sheet}[link:files/doc/cheat_sheet_rdoc.html].

    # Sequel converts two digit years in <tt>Date</tt>s and <tt>DateTime</tt>s by default,
    # so 01/02/03 is interpreted at January 2nd, 2003, and 12/13/99 is interpreted
    # as December 13, 1999. You can override this to treat those dates as
    # January 2nd, 0003 and December 13, 0099, respectively, by:
    #
    #   Sequel.convert_two_digit_years = false

    # database.  It defaults to +Time+.  To change it to +DateTime+:
    #
    #   Sequel.datetime_class = DateTime
    #
    # For ruby versions less than 1.9.2, +Time+ has a limited range (1901 to
    # 2038), so if you use datetimes out of that range, you need to switch
    # to +DateTime+.  Also, before 1.9.2, +Time+ can only handle local and UTC
    # times, not other timezones.  Note that +Time+ and +DateTime+ objects
    # have a different API, and in cases where they implement the same methods,
    # they often implement them differently (e.g. + using seconds on +Time+ and
    # days on +DateTime+).

    #   DB[:a].exclude(:b=>[])
    #   # SELECT * FROM a WHERE (b = b)
    #
    # However, some databases (e.g. MySQL) will perform very poorly
    # with this type of query.  You can set this to false to get the
    # following behavior:
    #
    #   DB[:a].filter(:b=>[])
    #   # SELECT * FROM a WHERE 1 = 0
    #   DB[:a].exclude(:b=>[])
    #   # SELECT * FROM a WHERE 1 = 1

    # This may not handle NULLs correctly, but can be much faster on
    # some databases.
