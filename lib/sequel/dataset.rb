  # A dataset represents an SQL query. Datasets
  # can be used to select, insert, update and delete records.
  #
  # Query results are always retrieved on demand, so a dataset can be kept
  # around and reused indefinitely (datasets never cache results):
  #
  #   my_posts = DB[:posts].where(author: 'david') # no records are retrieved
  #   my_posts.all # records are retrieved
  #   my_posts.all # records are retrieved again
  #
  # Datasets are frozen and use a functional style where modification methods
  # return modified copies of the the dataset.  This allows you to reuse
  # datasets:
  #
  #   posts = DB[:posts]
  #   davids_posts = posts.where(author: 'david')
  #   old_posts = posts.where{stamp < Date.today - 7}
  #   davids_old_posts = davids_posts.where{stamp < Date.today - 7}
  #
  # Datasets are Enumerable objects, so they can be manipulated using any
  # of the Enumerable methods, such as map, inject, etc.
  #
  # For more information, see the {"Dataset Basics" guide}[rdoc-ref:doc/dataset_basics.rdoc].
