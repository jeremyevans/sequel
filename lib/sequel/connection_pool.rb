# frozen-string-literal: true

# The base connection pool class, which all other connection pools are based
# on.  This class is not instantiated directly, but subclasses should at
# the very least implement the following API:
#
# initialize(Database, Hash) :: Initialize using the passed Sequel::Database
#                               object and options hash.
# hold(Symbol, &block) :: Yield a connection object (obtained from calling
#                         the block passed to +initialize+) to the current block. For sharded
#                         connection pools, the Symbol passed is the shard/server to use.
# disconnect(Symbol) :: Disconnect the connection object.  For sharded
#                       connection pools, the Symbol passed is the shard/server to use.
# servers :: An array of shard/server symbols for all shards/servers that this
#            connection pool recognizes.
# size :: an integer representing the total number of connections in the pool,
#         or for the given shard/server if sharding is supported.
# max_size :: an integer representing the maximum size of the connection pool,
#             or the maximum size per shard/server if sharding is supported.
#
# For sharded connection pools, the sharded API adds the following methods:
#
# add_servers(Array of Symbols) :: start recognizing all shards/servers specified
#                                  by the array of symbols.
# remove_servers(Array of Symbols) :: no longer recognize all shards/servers
#                                     specified by the array of symbols.
